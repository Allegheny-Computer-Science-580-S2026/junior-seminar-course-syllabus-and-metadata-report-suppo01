## Research Group Contributions

As a member of the Junior Seminar research group, document how you contributed
to the research community beyond your individual project. This section reflects
the collaborative nature of research work and your engagement with fellow
researchers.

### Peer Research Feedback

Document significant feedback you provided to other research group members
during presentations, demonstrations, or informal discussions. Include:

- **Researcher Name / Project**: [Name of peer researcher and their project]
- **Feedback Provided**: \[Brief description of the feedback, suggestions, or
  questions you contributed\]
- **Impact**: [If applicable, note how your feedback influenced their work]
- **Reference**: [Provide a link to a GitHub repository's issue tracker]

My entries:

- **Logan Greer / CaddySense AI Powered Assistant Tool**: Highlighted the use of a separate bulletpointed section as helpful
for defining topic central jargon; [Link to my issue in the issue tracker](https://github.com/Allegheny-Computer-Science-600610-25-26/senior-comprehensive-project-journal-and-chapters-greer01/issues/8)

- **Coltin Colucci / GDBuddy**: Suggested providing a working definition of HIL for those unfamiliar with the process and a
clearer system for referencing sources; [Link to my issue in the issue tracker](https://github.com/Allegheny-Computer-Science-600610-25-26/senior-comprehensive-project-journal-and-chapters-Coltin2121/issues/6)

### Technical Discussions and Problem-Solving

Document instances where you participated in collaborative technical
discussions or helped fellow researchers troubleshoot issues:

- **Discussion Topic / Problem**: [Brief description]
- **Your Contribution**: [What you shared, suggested, or helped debug]
- **Outcome**: [How it helped advance the research]

My entries:

- **Autumn Davison / Creating a Website**: Shared knowledge of webflow and a strategy for making a website (using a web
design agent that generates the html code that corresponds to the design) as well as knowledge that CSS is needed to correctly
size the site and pointed in the direction of Prof. Luman as a helpful resource; Advanced the research by giving a good sense
of next steps in development.

### Research Group Meeting Participation

Note particularly meaningful contributions during research group meetings:

- **Meeting Date / Topic**: [When and what]
- **Contribution**: [Question asked, insight shared, or resource provided]
- **Value to Group**: [How it benefited the research community]

Example entries:

- **Week 4 / Research Ethics Discussion**: Raised important questions about
  data privacy in web scraping projects; led to productive discussion about
  `robots.txt` and ethical boundaries
- **Week 9 / Writing Workshop**: Shared effective strategies for writing
  related work sections; multiple researchers found it helpful because it
  clarified the way they should structure the second chapter of their report
- **Week 11 / Results Visualization**: Demonstrated `matplotlib` customization
  techniques; several researchers adopted similar approaches

### Research Resources Shared

Document any research papers, tools, tutorials, or other resources you shared
with the research group that helped advance collective knowledge:

- **Resource**: [Paper title, tool name, tutorial link, etc.]
- **Shared With**: [Individual researcher or entire group]
- **Purpose**: [Why you shared it and how it was relevant]

Example entries:

- **"Testing in Production" Paper**: Shared with entire group during Week 7;
  relevant for multiple systems research projects
- **Plotly Visualization Tutorial**: Shared with four researchers working on
  data-heavy projects; enabled interactive visualizations
- **arXiv Paper on Neural Architecture Search**: Shared with Sarah Lee for her
  AutoML project; became a key reference in her related work chapter
